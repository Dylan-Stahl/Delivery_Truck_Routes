# Delivery_Truck_Routes

## Application Need Scenario
The Western Governorâ€™s University Parcel System needed to find efficient routes to distribute their packages in a time and distance efficient manner. 
Assumptions were as following: packages must be delivered by their deadlines, there are three trucks, two truck drivers, each truck travels at a constant 
18 miles per hour, and an average of 40 packages are to be delivered each day. The problem closely mimics the traveling salesman problem, which is an 
NP-hard problem.
